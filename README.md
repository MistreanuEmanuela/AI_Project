# AI Project: FeedBack HHC

This project aims to conduct a detailed analysis of patient opinions regarding the quality of care provided by home healthcare agencies. Using a dataset available at CMS Provider Data, the project seeks to uncover information about the performance of these agencies and explore factors influencing patient care quality. The ultimate goal is to provide predictions about patient care quality based on specific factors.

The dataset includes a wide range of information related to home healthcare agencies, with the target variable being the quality of patient care. The dataset will be thoroughly explored, cleaned, and processed to ensure its suitability for analysis. Descriptive statistics and visualizations will be used to provide a comprehensive overview of the data.
